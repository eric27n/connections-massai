# Connections-MassAI
This is the repository for the MassAI Connections Project.

Group 26, MassAI Spring 2025

## How To Run

Run the following python command in terminal:
```
python -m flask --app app run
```

Make sure you have all libraries downloaded properly. Use `pip install` followed 
by the module if you run into any ModuleNotFound errors. I would also recommend 
copy-pasting your error into ChatGPT and following its suggestions.

NOTE: You will need to have `numberbatch-en-19.08.txt.gz` downloaded to be able 
to properly run the Flask app. Refer to the Python notebook on how to get that 
downloaded. Make sure you do not include that file, the `.env` file, the 
`__pycache__` folder (if applicable), and any other large/sensitive files in 
your `.gitignore`.
