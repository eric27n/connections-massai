    "**PLEASE READ:** Python notebooks are a pain in the ass to try and merge in Github. This means that if you make an edit here, but someone else already made changes to this file, then trying to complete a git merge will be much harder for this file than, say, a normal Python file. This ultimately boils down to an ipynb *technically* being a JSON, and there's a lot of things going on under the hood that makes conflicts much more likely (incidentally, this is also the reason why if you and multiple people try to work on the same file on Google Colab, you're going to get messages about \"unable to save local changes\" and conflicts). As a result, **please do not modify this file.** Instead, **create a copy of this file and make your changes there** (e.g. `connections-notebook-[your-name].ipynb`)."
